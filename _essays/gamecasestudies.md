<h1>Case Studies of Video Games</h1>

This will a space to publish some personal notes for research on case studies of games. Far from being an expert, I do not in fact have any experience playing video games. I'll just be parroting (and compiling) others' thoughts, mostly for my own reference. Also, learning how to [link in markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown/links) as I go!

<h2>A look into RPGs</h2>
The investigation begins with the Legend of Zelda, one of the first results from "Popular games" and a name I hear often. Wikipedia pointed out the debate between its status as an action game or an RPG. Now, I'm curious.

<h3>RPGs</h3>

- Elements commonly seen: stats, leveling, inventory ([Samuraipizzaguy on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/9lz0nh/what_is_a_difference_between_an_rpg_and_an/));Progression and itemization ([Clownsheuz on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/9lz0nh/what_is_a_difference_between_an_rpg_and_an/))
- Story and character are important
- [**Types**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/): 
  - MMORPG - Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (World of Warcraft)
  - ARPG - Action Role-Playing Game (Elder Ring, Borderlands)
  - CRPG - Computer or Console Role-Playing Game (Dragon Age, Disco Elysium)
  - TTRPG - Tabletop Role-Playing Game (D&D)
  - JRPG & WRPG - Japanese and Western RPGs (Pokemon, Persona; Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077)

<h3>Open-World Games</h3>

- [Merriam-Webster Definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/open%20world): a video game or part of a video game in which the player is not constrained to achieving specific goals and has a large degree of freedom to explore, interact with, or modify the game environment
- **Key Point**: Player autonomy; freedom in approach within constraints of gameplay ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world))
- Mostly a marketing term, non-linear gameplay ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/10mct5f/what_makes_a_game_open_world/))
- Not mutually exclusive with with RPG and action games
- [Examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world): Legend of Zelda, Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft

<h4>Sandbox Games</h4>

- I would say this is often a sub-trait of open-world games. Open-world allows endless *exploration* while sandbox specifically entails endless possibility for *creation* and *modification* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world))
- Examples: The Sims, GTA, Minecraft

<h2>Text-based Games</h2>

I'm particular interested in text-based games as I explore the gameification of a text-based user interface. I want to investigate **a)** how to make pure text *engaging*, **b)** what systems are in place for stickiness and progression, and **c)** how they are developed.
