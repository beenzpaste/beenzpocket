<h1>Ways of Classifying Personality</h1>

Notes: [06/23,26/25] 

Taking a look at how personalities — or, more broadly, the unique traits that make up a person's psyche — have been classified historically. I want to investigate, in particular, different personality tests and: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **a)** the particular characteristics that are determined as governing factors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **b)** what it can tell us, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **c)** how effectively they capture human complexity, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **d)** whether and if so, why, they are popular.<br>


<h2>The "Big Five"</h2>

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

- Openness: to experiences and minds; curiosity 
- Conscientiousness: systematic, orderly
- Extroversion: sociable
- Agreeableness: compassion, empathy
- Neuroticism: emotional stability

What I found fascinating was that these Five were determined by statistically identifying clusters in English words used to describe personality traits ([Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/big-5-personality-traits#measuring-the-big-five)). Love me some statistically determined systems!

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>
The Big Five give names to characteristics that can define and differentiate different personalities. Particular traits are essentially linear combinations of these Five.
[Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/big-5-personality-traits) claims evidence exists linking the Five to other outcomes, such as extroversion with subjective well-being, neuroticism with lower work commitment, and agreeableness with religion.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

Compared to other tests, I think this test skirts the tendency to categorize. Rather than putting you in one box or the other, it illustrates where you fall on the spectrum of several characteristics. Evaluating this test makes me examine what "personality" even means — *are* there aspects of personality that haven't been covered? 

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

While it covers decent ground with personality tests, I think its criteria are too abstract to be an easy sell. I hadn't heard of this personality test before research, and I can imagine it's because it doesn't give a straight, packaged answer. Because it takes more care with human complexity, it is also less catchy.

<h3>Taking the Test</h3>

Open-source online test: [Big Five Personality Test](https://bigfive-test.com/)

Personal Thoughts: This was genuinely fun. Where it's usually easy to parse the test once you know the criterion it is testing for, this test gave more detailed insights that I hadn't expected. It made the results very fun to go through — highly recommend!

<h2>Enneagram</h2>

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

According to the [Enneagram Institute website](www.enneagraminstitute.com), here is my simplified summary of the system:

<div style="justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
  <figure style="text-align: center;">

  </figure>
</div>

- There are Nine types
- They fall in a 3x3 arrangement around three *Centers*: The Instinctive, Thinking, and Feeling Centers. They  deal with a core emotional response of Anger, Shame, and Fear, respectively.
- Each person has a basic personality type and *one* of the two adjacent types on the circumference, or their *wing*.
- Extras: There are also *Levels of Development* that account for differences between people and personal changes for better or worse. There is said to be three levels that are healthy, average, and unhealthy each, and directions of Integration (Growth) and Disintegration (Stress).

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>

Personally, this felt like an exaggerated attempt at spinning a contrived system into science. It uses elaborate (and wordy!) explanations to mask a lack of solid evidence and reasoning for its construction. Reading its explanation made my head hurt.

Upon taking the test, however, the results may glean insights into your main motivators (and consequently, fears). The addition of wings and indicators of healthy or unhealthy progression can also be helpful insights, especially the latter, which can act as benchmarks to understand your own inclinations and what thought patterns may be to your benefit or detriment.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

There is only so much complexity that can retained by placing people into distinct types. The Enneagram compensates for that with wings and progression levels, but...

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

... I think the Enneagram has taken the route of least return. It forgoes the appeal of simple categories by overcomplicating its system in a *futile* attempt at capturing true human complexity. 

<h3>Taking the Test</h3>

Of course, to no surprise of mine, the official test is paid. I chose this [open-source version](https://enneagramuniverse.com/) randomly. Apparently, every test is paid if you want an in-depth report.

Strangely, when I took [this test](https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test) that turned out to be paid, it was a drag. However, this [allegedly free version](https://enneagramuniverse.com/) had interesting prompts and I became more intrigued as I worked my way towards recognizing my personality match. It not only felt accurate, but the measure was shockingly accurate for its specificity.

<h2>DiSC </h2>

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

<div style="justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">

</div>

- (D)ominance: tend to be confident and place an emphasis on accomplishing bottom-line results
- (i)nfluence: tend to be more open and place an emphasis on relationships and influencing or persuading others
- (S)teadiness: tend to be dependable and place an emphasis on cooperation and sincerity
- (C)onscientiousness: tend to place an emphasis on quality, accuracy, expertise, and competency

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>

Sold to companies as a tool for better understanding employee behavioral and teamwork styles, it's upfront about being for dialogue rather than diagnosis and seems to mainly focus on recognizing patterns and tendencies. Reminds me of the IDI Assessment I had to do for university.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

I don't think this professes to be a wholistic assessment of human personality. As marketed, I believe that it's specific to one's interpersonal interaction, communication, conflict resolution style. However, its simplification into just four categories does little to provide valuable insight beyond already obvious attributes. I also feel that each box has a random collection of traits that don't feel quite methodical — does dependability always coincide with cooperation and sincerity?

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>
Probably at most popular among companies. Never heard of it.

<h3>Taking the Test</h3>

As the original test is paid, I took [this one](https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/) first. I also took [this one](https://onlinediscprofile.com). Be forewarned: both of their (free) results are *very* brief. 

It was very easy to recognize exactly what the test was assessing for. Taking it was a drag. I could tell my DiSC type before and during the test; getting results felt less rewarding, more like a waste of time.

<h2>EQ</h2>

While one of the most well-known measurements of... a person, there is no one standardized, "original", "true" test. EQ has made its way into the social consciousness rather than being an isolated concept. 

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

Just looking briefly at some of the most common/popular tests, there seems to be no standard way of or criteria for measuring EQ. Each tests takes different approaches and names the governing characteristics differently. However, in summary, I would say they are:
- Understanding of own emotions
- Managing own emotions
- Expressing emotion
- Perceiving others' emotions (others)
- Actions in relation to emotion

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>

Emotions play a central role to human expression, interaction, communication, and existence. Evaluating one's ability to recognize, address, and handle them can speak a lot about them. This can go even beyond personality; rather than a box of behavior and tendencies, EQ speaks to maturity, resilience, and *humanity* that can span all different personalities. There's no objective merit to a higher score but a collective agreement to its benefit for richer relationships and quality of life.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

Despite just professing its merits, no single number can claim to capture human complexity. Digits can mislead its wielders into reducing the assessment into a numeric value, misinformedly comparing them or somehow measuring one's worth accordingly. The subject that EQ seeks to measure is complex — the EQ score itself is not.

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

It would be tough to find someone who doesn't know of EQ and IQ. They have been hailed as the definitive standard for intelligence in its two main forms, if not literally then at least in the cultural consciousness.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

It can exist beyond the "original" test from the creators. There's a sense that everyone can decipher and diagnose their own MBTI, which provides an appealing sense of autonomy that many other exclusive, elusive personality tests don't.

<h2>Personality Tests, In General</h2>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

Many tests, in their original form (by their original creator) are behind a paywall. Thus, many times I chose to take free online versions. I don't know how true they are to the "original"; at the same time, if the original creators do not provide its test or test results openly, its methods may simply not deserve the reverence of being "true". A paywall may seek to preserve a veneer of high calibre and establishment, yet fall into the trap of obsolescence. At the end of the day, it is the tests that are free and open that will be taken.

<h3>Assessment Methods</h3>

What I found interesting were the modes of the questions. I certainly can't speak to their merits according to test type, as I was unable to take most of the "original" tests. However, even within one test type, each open-source version approached the evaluation differently.

**General Trends:**
- Rating statements on *accuracy*; rating criteria ranged from *accuracy* to *agreement* to *liking/disliking*
- Some criteria changed from statement group to statement group
**Most Interesting**: For this [free DiSC test](https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/), statements were grouped in four. Rather than rating each one, I was made to choose one I agreed with most and one, least. This was different, but made it supremely easy to identify which statement corresponded with which result. I'm guess-hoping that the paid test is a little more subtle.
