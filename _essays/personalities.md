<h1>Ways of Classifying Personality</h1>

Notes: [06/23,26/25] 

Taking a look at how personalities — or, more broadly, the unique traits that make up a person's psyche — have been classified historically. I want to investigate, in particular, different personality tests and: **a)** the particular characteristics that are determined as governing factors, **b)** what it can tell us, **c)**how effectively they capture human complexity, and **d)** whether and if so, why, they are popular.


<h2>The "Big Five"</h2>

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

- Openness: to experiences and minds; curiosity 
- Conscientiousness: systematic, orderly
- Extroversion: sociable
- Agreeableness: compassion, empathy
- Neuroticism: emotional stability

What I found fascinating was that these Five were determined by statistically identifying clusters in English words used to describe personality traits ([Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/big-5-personality-traits#measuring-the-big-five)). Love me some statistically determined systems!

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>
The Big Five give names to characteristics that can define and differentiate different personalities. Particular traits are essentially linear combinations of these Five.
[Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/big-5-personality-traits) claims evidence exists linking the Five to other outcomes, such as extroversion with subjective well-being, neuroticism with lower work commitment, and agreeableness with religion.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

Compared to other tests, I think this test skirts the tendency to categorize. Rather than putting you in one box or the other, it illustrates where you fall on the spectrum of several characteristics. Evaluating this test makes me examine what "personality" even means — *are* there aspects of personality that haven't been covered? 

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

While it covers decent ground with personality tests, I think its criteria are too abstract to be an easy sell. I hadn't heard of this personality test before research, and I can imagine it's because it doesn't give a straight, packaged answer. Because it takes more care with human complexity, it is also less catchy.

<h3>Taking the Test</h3>

Open-source online test: [Big Five Personality Test](https://bigfive-test.com/)

Personal Thoughts: This was genuinely fun. Where it's usually easy to parse the test once you know the criterion it is testing for, this test gave more detailed insights that I hadn't expected. It made the results very fun to go through — highly recommend!

<h2>Enneagram</h2>

<h3>a) Governing characteristics:</h3>

According to the [Enneagram Institute website](www.enneagraminstitute.com), here is my simplified summary of the system:

</div>

- There are Nine types
- They fall in a 3x3 arrangement around three *Centers*: The Instinctive, Thinking, and Feeling Centers. They  deal with a core emotional response of Anger, Shame, and Fear, respectively.
- Each person has a basic personality type and *one* of the two adjacent types on the circumference, or their *wing*.
- Extras: There are also *Levels of Development* that account for differences between people and personal changes for better or worse. There is said to be three levels that are healthy, average, and unhealthy each, and directions of Integration (Growth) and Disintegration (Stress).

<h3>b) What can it tell us?</h3>

Personally, this felt like an exaggerated attempt at spinning a contrived system into science. It uses elaborate (and wordy!) explanations to mask a lack of solid evidence and reasoning for its construction. Reading its explanation made my head hurt.

Upon taking the test, however, the results may glean insights into your main motivators (and consequently, fears). The addition of wings and indicators of healthy or unhealthy progression can also be helpful insights, especially the latter, which can act as benchmarks to understand your own inclinations and what thought patterns may be to your benefit or detriment.

<h3>c) Capturing Human Complexity</h3>

There is only so much complexity that can retained by placing people into distinct types. The Enneagram compensates for that with wings and progression levels, but...

<h3>d) Popularity</h3>

... I think the Enneagram has taken the route of least return. It forgoes the appeal of simple categories by overcomplicating its system in a *futile* attempt at capturing true human complexity. 

<h3>Taking the Test</h3>

Of course, to no surprise of mine, the official test is paid. I chose this [open-source version](https://enneagramuniverse.com/) randomly. Apparently, every test is paid if you want an in-depth report.

Strangely, when I took [this test](https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test) that turned out to be paid, it was a drag. However, this [allegedly free version](https://enneagramuniverse.com/) had interesting prompts and I became more intrigued as I worked my way towards recognizing my personality match. It not only felt accurate, but the measure was shockingly accurate for its specificity.
