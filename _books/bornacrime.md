A genuine all-time favorite. Just as good (if not better) the second time round! People wavering below 5 stars who haven't listened to the audiobook definitely should--the memoir is narrated by Trevor Noah himself, and his literal and literary voice shine. The variations of humor and solemnity, tones and accents, delivered in his characteristic speech, bring his stories to life. I AM SUCH A BIG FAN!!!

Note: I am a big fan of Trevor Noah. Review may be heavily biased.

Objectively, I also appreciate that this memoir almost entirely skirts his successful career as a comedian, host, or celebrity. The contents don't bank on his popularity (though its publication might have) but rather divulge the personal and societal ramifications of apartheid, history, and racism on local culture, society, economics, and livelihoods. He discusses poverty, domestic abuse, and religion; childhood, motherhood, and the hood. His story is at once incredibly personal yet touchingly universal; his voice is never overbearing and always deeply compassionate. I urge anyone to read it. You will find that no matter how much you thought you knew, Trevor Noah will bring new insights. Sigh. Once again... I AM SUCH A BIG FAN!!!
