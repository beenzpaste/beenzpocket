 The liberties the author seemed to take in fictionalizing, "mysticizing", and sensationalizing the scientists' lives make me uncomfortable. I did not enjoy reading those parts, and it disturbed me into reconsidering a lesser rating, despite understanding the author's purpose in depicting the darker sides of science. Yet discussing with my dad, I explained myself into conjecturing that the author means to pose a question: if groundbreaking breakthroughs occur through despicable means, is scientific advancement even desirable?

Read with my dad after recommending it to him. It was nice to have a human quantum physics encyclopedia on hand, but I was honestly so enraptured every time I began reading that I could not look up. Every sentence gripped me such that I felt I would be lost the second I looked away. Gave me a new perspective and understanding of science - particularly math and physics, the most abstract and impalpable - and I suspect I'll think of this for years to come.
