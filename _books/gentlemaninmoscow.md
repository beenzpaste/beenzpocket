If I wasn’t convinced enough already, this book (and this Amor Towles) receiving a blurb from Ann Patchett herself solidifies these two as my reigning god tier authors, from whom I will read anything.

Six stars, new obsession

Review (06/24/24):

Something I've come to realize I crave in novels is genuine insight into the world, but crucially through humor, humility, and humanity*. Regardless of the story itself, it's the sincerity with which its written that captures and immerses me. Honestly it's something I struggle with, because most of the time you pick up a book for the synopsis, but time and again I've been pleasantly surprised. Of course, the setting of this story was nothing to complain about. I absolutely loved the concept of house arrest in a hotel and following Alexander as he navigates the grand estate, discovers its crooks and nannies, meets characters of interest, and makes illuminating insights.

More importantly (to me) above all are the characters. They're the agents through which an author conveys the soul of their work, and both Ann Patchett and Amor Towles are capable of bringing people to life. They are of flesh and flaw, perfect in their imperfections and either to love or to empathize with. Narrator and side (what an insufficient word for the persons looming large they are) characters alike.

Also, plainly, their writing is good. It's not overdone, gimmicky, neither dense nor fluffy. That's not to say it's not stylized or full of character--in fact, it shines with personality. It's why I can immerse myself for hours at a time, my eyes never leaving the page, feeling not as if I'm reading but in their world. I NEED MORE OF THAT! (it's an attention span thing)

*i just needed that alliteration. coincidentally, this is also something that amor towles sprinkled in! it just tickles me SILLY when an author hones in on his craft so fully and deliberately. i could feel it wasn't (merely) for flair, but was part of the character--of course Alexander is the type of gentleman to show off a little--and done full of joy and good humor, rather than some contrived attempt at purple prose.
